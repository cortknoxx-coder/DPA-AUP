# DPA Portal — Feature Wiring Map

This document captures every feature pathway that existed in the mock data,
what each one powers in the UI, and its current wiring status.

Use this as your checklist when implementing. When a feature gets wired to
real data (device firmware, creator input, or backend API), update the status.

## Legend

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **WIRED** | Connected to live data (device firmware or creator input) |
| **EMPTY** | Structural placeholder exists, no mock data, needs real data source |
| **STUB** | Component exists but feature logic is incomplete |
| **NOT STARTED** | No implementation yet |

## WHAT STILL NEEDS REAL DATA SOURCES

These features have UI but need a backend or real data to be useful:

1. **UserService** (Account tab) — needs auth + user API
2. **Marketplace** — needs transaction/listing backend
3. **Resales / Economics** — needs sales tracking backend
4. **Booklet media** — needs file upload storage for images/videos (Vercel Blob ready)
5. **Payment methods** — needs payment gateway (Stripe etc.)
6. **Earnings / Payouts** — needs financial backend

These are Phase 5-6 features that require additional backend infrastructure.
